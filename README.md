# spinjitsu
I had seen someone make a spinning ascii donute in c, so Im going to try and make a spinning ascii cube in rust.

## Sorry about the bad code
This is like my third project ever in rust, in case you havent noticed, so give me a little bit of a brake.

## How to run
To compile and run just follow the steps below
```bash
cargo run
```
